Tower of Hanoi

Step 1: Start 
Step 2: Input the number of disks 
Step 3: Create a stack to hold the disks 
Step 4: Push the disks onto the stack 
Step 5: Create helper stacks to hold the disks 
Step 6: Move the top disk from the first stack to one of the helper stacks, and then the top disk from the helper stack to the remaining stack 
Step 7: Keep repeating step 6 until all the disks have been moved to the final stack 
Step 8: End 

Greatest Common Divisor 

Step 1: Start 
Step 2: Input two numbers 
Step 3: Create a stack and push the two numbers onto it 
Step 4: Pop the two numbers off the stack 
Step 5: Check if one of the numbers is 0 
Step 6: If one of the numbers is 0, the other number is the divisor 
Step 7: Otherwise, push both numbers onto the stack 
Step 8: Subtract the smaller number from the larger number and push the result onto the stack 
Step 9: Keep repeating steps 4-8 until one of the numbers is 0 
Step 10: The other number is the divisor 
Step 11: End 

Hailstone Sequence 

Step 1: Start 
Step 2: Input a number 
Step 3: Create a stack and push the number onto it 
Step 4: Pop the number off the stack 
Step 5: Check if the number is 1 
Step 6: If the number is 1, the sequence is complete 
Step 7: Otherwise, push the number onto the stack 
Step 8: Check if the number is even 
Step 9: If the number is even, divide it by 2 and push the result onto the stack 
Step 10: Otherwise, multiply the number by 3 and add 1 and push the result onto the stack 
Step 11: Keep repeating steps 4-10 until the number is 1 
Step 12: End 

Fibonacci Series 

Step 1: Start 
Step 2: Input the number of terms 
Step 3: Create a stack and push two terms (0 and 1) onto it 
Step 4: Pop the two terms off the stack 
Step 5: Add the two terms and push the result onto the stack 
Step 6: Keep repeating steps 4-5 until the desired number of terms has been reached 
Step 7: End 

Factorial of Number Using Recursive Stack 

Step 1: Start 
Step 2: Input a number 
Step 3: Create a stack and push the number onto it 
Step 4: Pop the number off the stack 
Step 5: Check if the number is 1 
Step 6: If the number is 1, the result is 1 
Step 7: Otherwise, push the number onto the stack 
Step 8: Subtract 1 from the number and push the result onto the stack 
Step 9: Keep repeating steps 4-8 until the number is 1 
Step 10: Multiply all the numbers on the stack to get the result 
Step 11: End
